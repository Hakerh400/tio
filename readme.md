This is an online version of the [Hakerh400/esolangs](https://github.com/Hakerh400/esolangs) repository. You can try programming languages directly in your browser. Code snippets can be exported in a form of a code golf answer (including byte count and a permanent link to the code snippet).

The website is located at https://hakerh400.github.io/tio. In order to open it, your browser must support ECMAScript Next features (or at least the latest stable ECMAScript). Here is the current compatibility table:

* **Chrome** - Full support
* **Firefox** - Works only in the Nightly version with flag `javascript.options.experimental.private_fields` enabled
* **Safari** - Does not work (because Safari did not implement private class fields yet)
* **Edge** - Not supported
* **Other browsers** - Not tested
